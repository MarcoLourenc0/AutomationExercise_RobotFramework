POM was used (Page Object model). Design pattern that separates the representation of web pages from testing logic. This means that you create a separate class for each web page or page component and store the locators and methods for interacting with page elements in that class. You then use the objects from these classes in your test scripts, rather than directly accessing the web elements. This way, you can avoid code duplication, reduce the impact of UI changes, and make your code more modular and readable.
